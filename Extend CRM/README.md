#Extend CRM#

What you get from CRM out of the box is limited and therefor the major part of the work done on Dynamics CRM projects is on extensions.
There are 2 common ways to extend CRM:
- Web Resources;
- Plugins

Different developers deal with this differently as there are many options and tool that can help you achieving this.
Personally I prefer to use <a href="https://xrmtoolkit.com/">XRM Toolkit</a> for this purpose, this is not an Open Source Tool but you have a 30-days trail to play around with it.

Here is a Step by Step guide that beginners might find helpful:

1. You want to start by downloading and installing XRM Toolkit:
To make sure that installing was done properly open your Visual Studio and you should be able to find this tab added:
